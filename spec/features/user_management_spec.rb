# Strictly speaking, the tests that check the UI 
  # (have_content, etc.) should be separate from the tests 
  # that check what we have in the DB. The reason is that 
  # you should test one thing at a time, whereas
  # by mixing the two we're testing both 
  # the business logic and the views.
  #
  # However, let's not worry about this yet 
  # to keep the example simple.
